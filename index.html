    <h2 style="color:blue">The Wiggles - The Early Years</h2>

    <h3 style="color:blue" style="font:message-box" > When the Yardlings split in 1968, lead guitarist Jimmy Beige wasted no time putting together a new band. The reasons were partly pragmatic: the now-dissolved group still had some tour dates left on the docket in Denmark and Sweden, so Beige's new project would fulfill those obligations.
        But mostly, Beige wanted to form a band which emphasized guitars, yet still boasted impeccable overall musicianship.  Beige first found two kindred spirits in vocalist Robert Blant and drummer John Bottom, who had been bandmates in an English group called Band of Joy. Bassist Ron Paul Jones, who knew Beige from their shared days in the session musician world, completed the lineup of the original Wiggles.</h3>
